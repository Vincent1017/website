            <p>Counter-Strike Global Offensive or CSGO for short, is a fast paced team based fps, in which, in ranked matches, two teams of five go against each other under the teams of counter terrorists and terrorists. The community is <b>EXTREMELY</b> toxic in most cases so be prepared for harassment if your new to the game, and/or you don't perform at your best. Other than the community the game is all around fun to play. It is both hard to play and hard to master, so be ready to grind if you want to get a high rank. A warning for any who play this game, do <b>NOT</b> get caught up into the world of skins, it will cost you your life and family.</p>

        <p>Player Unkowns Battlegrounds or more commonly known as PUBG is a free roaming 100 player battle royale, in which the players drop from a cargo plane that flies over the entirety of the map, and players must scavenge for loot and head to the play area, which will be marked by a white cricle. This game is fun to play alone, but I find that the most entertainment can be taken from his game when played with friends. PUBG has recently started to go downhill with recent skin additions and the such, starting to turn into a CSGO copy, however, the updates for weapons and their balancing makes it still playable and enjoyable.</p>

        <p>Skyrim is agurably one of the best open world games that has ever come out. It has an extremely long playtime, hundreds of side quests, multiple different skills to master, and an economic system that can be tracked (for the most part). Skyrim is a medieval and magic based rpg that can be played in both first or third person. This game will make you lose track of your time, your kids, and your job. It is both fun to play, and fun to mod, as there is a large community that provides a workshop full of different mods for you to explore. This game is best purchased off steam, and not the newly updated one, but the original, as the new version of Skyrim has issues that affect gameplay.</p>
